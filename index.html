Sensor readings may include date and time information, sensor type, setpoints, exposure readings and information regarding the overall health of the sensor.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style7">Configuration changes to the instrument:</span><span class="style8"> </span><span class="style1"> If you change settings like instrument name, setpoints or other configuration options on your instrument, that information is stored within the instrument and then uploaded to Safety io Applications.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style7">Usage and performance information:</span><span class="style8"> </span><span class="style1"> Every time your instrument is used, it records information about the usage and performance of the instrument (e.g., the time and duration of instrument use). This information is uploaded to Safety io Applications. Every time you use Safety io Applications, we collect information about your computer, phone, tablet, or other devices you use to access the Applications. Such information includes your connection type and settings when you install, access, update, or use our Applications. We also collect information through your device about your operating system, browser type, IP address, URLs of referring/exit pages, device identifiers, and crash data. We use your IP address and/or country preference in order to approximate your location to provide you with a better Service experience. How much of this information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the Services.</span></p><p class="p_style3"><span class="style7">Technical information from the device:</span><span class="style8"> </span><span class="style1"> In order to improve your customer experience and help troubleshoot any problem you may encounter with Safety io Applications, we record your device model and serial number, sensor serial numbers, firmware version, and technical information such as sensor status, network connectivity, periodic logs, power status, battery charge level and whether application features are working properly.</span></p><p class="p_style6"><span class="style7">Mobile location data:</span><span class="style8"> </span><span class="style1"> For our Live Monitor application, you’ll be asked for permission to share location data from your mobile device. If you grant this permission, the Safety io app uses standard location services built into iOS and Android. This data may be processed or combined with data from other applications to enhance features.</span></p><span id="page4"></span><p class="p_style1"><span class="style7">Information you provide:</span><span class="style8"> </span><span class="style1"> When you set up or manage one of the Safety io Applications, you are required to enter a certain amount of information in order to maximize your use of this service. For example, Safety io will collect the IP Address of one or more Galaxy GX2 Test Banks, which allows Fleet Manager to access your instrument data.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style7">Network Information:</span><span class="style8"> </span><span class="style1"> To connect any device that interfaces with a Safety io Application over the Internet from a computer, a smartphone or a tablet, you will need to connect the device to your network via Wi-Fi, ethernet or LTE. During setup of a Wi-Fi network, you will be prompted to input your Wi-Fi network name (SSID) and password to connect to the Internet. It will save this information on the device, along with your IP address, so that you can access it and control it from your computer, smartphone or tablet, and so that it can communicate with Safety io servers and download software updates. Once connected to your network, your device regularly sends the data described in this Privacy Statement (excluding your Wi-Fi password) to Safety io to provide you with the Services.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style7">Additional Authorized Users:</span><span class="style8"> </span><span class="style1"> Safety io may provide you with the ability to enable additional authorized users to access your account. If you do so, the additional authorized users may control and view all of your devices, content, and connections. Invited users may also add additional authorized users to your account, so be careful to add only those you trust. Information about invited users (like email address and name) will be stored with your account.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style7">Email Addresses:</span><span class="style8"> </span><span class="style1"> When you create a Safety io account, we collect and store your email address. From that point forward, your email address is used for communications from Safety io. In addition, Safety io may provide you with the ability to enable individuals to access your account as additional authorized users, or to send notifications to other individuals to view content such as daily reports, sensor replacement or gas replacement notifications. We will ask you for the email address of any such individuals and automatically send an email invitation on your behalf. Safety io stores this information to send this email.</span></p><p class="p_style3"><span class="style7">Basic Profile Information:</span><span class="style8"> </span><span class="style1"> Your account allows you to provide certain basic profile information like your name. Your name may be shown to others in connection with the Services. In addition, if you download any Safety io Mobile App, we may collect and store your mobile device identifiers (such as IDFA, AAID, or other device identifiers). For example, if you invite someone as an additional authorized user, he or she will be able to see your name.</span></p><p class="p_style3"><span class="style7">Bluetooth data:</span><span class="style8"> </span><span class="style1"> Bluetooth-enabled Safety io Applications may broadcast an identifying signal wirelessly. This is used to connect with your Bluetooth-enabled devices (such as a smartphone or tablet) in order to deliver features within Live Monitor.</span></p><p class="p_style3"><span class="style7">MSA Companies:</span><span class="style8"> </span><span class="style1"> We may receive information about you from companies that are owned or operated by our ultimate parent company, MSA Safety Incorporated, in accordance with terms and policies of those companies.</span></p><p class="p_style7"><span class="style1">In addition, Safety io may send data to Safety io GmbH and other affiliates of MSA Safety Incorporated for the purpose of marketing, facilitating or improving the Safety io Applications or MSA Safety Incorporated products.</span></p><span id="page5"></span><p class="p_style0"><span class="style0">What information is shared among multiple connected Safety io Applications?</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style1">If you have multiple Safety io Applications interfacing with one another, the applications will share certain information with each other. For example, the mobile application ALTAIR Connect provides GPS location and alarm status to Live Monitor, and Live Monitor can push evacuation alerts to multiple instruments via ALTAIR Connect. This sharing may occur locally among connected devices, between Safety io Applications and your mobile device or application, or among Safety io’s servers.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style0">How does my Safety io Application or account interact with third parties?</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style1">Safety io may use third parties when providing its applications and services to customers. Any data you choose to share when using Safety io Applications is subject to and governed by such third party’s privacy policy while in that party’s possession, and Safety io has no responsibility for such data. Customer data gathered from Safety io Applications is never shared with third-party marketers or spammers except in an anonymized and aggregated manner.</span></p><p class="p_style3"><span class="style1">Any data that Safety io receives from third-parties will be processed and stored by Safety io and will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Statement. This information may be processed in the same ways as any other data that is a part of your Safety io account or the Safety io logs.</span></p><p class="p_style3"><span class="style0">How does Safety io use the information it collects?</span></p><p class="p_style3"><span class="style1">Generally speaking, we use collected information to provide, develop, and improve Safety io Applications, including to make assessments and recommendations to you about products or safety. We may use your contact details to send you this information, or to ask you to participate in surveys about your Safety io use, and to send you other communications from Safety io, when in accordance with applicable privacy law.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style1">We may also use this information in an anonymized form for research purposes and to help us make product development, sales, marketing, and business decisions. We may use service providers to perform some of these functions. Those service providers are restricted from sharing this anonymized information for any purpose other than as described above.</span></p><p class="p_style5"><span class="style1">We may use your information to resolve technical issues you encounter, to respond to your requests for assistance, to analyze crash information, and to repair and improve the Services.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style1">In general for purposes of applicable law (e.g., GDPR), Safety io is a processor of the information collected in connection with the Applications and Services.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style0">In what circumstances does Safety io share my information?</span></p><p class="p_style5"><span class="style1">Under no circumstance do we share personal information for any commercial or marketing purpose unrelated to the activation and delivery of Safety io Applications and services without asking you first. We do not rent or sell our customer lists.
